Here are a few tips to help keep your dry skin protected: 1. Use a sunscreen with a high SPF: Auolive's Day Glower moisturizer is a great option as it contains SPF 30 with UVA/UVB protection. This will help to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays. 2. Reapply sunscreen regularly: Sunscreen should be reapplied every 2 hours, or immediately after swimming or sweating. 3. Moisturize your skin: Dry skin is often caused by a lack of moisture, so it's important to keep your skin hydrated. Auolive's Night Restorer moisturizer is a great option as it hydrates, moisturizes and locks in moisture, leaving your skin feeling soft and supple. 4. Wear protective clothing: Wearing clothing that covers your skin, such as long sleeves and pants, can help to protect your skin from the sun's rays. 5. Avoid prolonged sun exposure: Try to limit your time in the sun during peak hours (between 10am and 4pm) when the sun's rays are the strongest. 6. Drink enough water, staying hydrated is crucial to keeping your skin healthy and moisturized. It's also important to consult with a dermatologist before starting any new skin routine to ensure that it is suitable for your skin type. \nQ: How to keep my face fresh and soft? \n: Here are some tips to keep your face fresh and soft: 1. Cleanse your face twice a day, in the morning and at night, with a gentle cleanser to remove dirt, makeup, and impurities. 2. Use a moisturizer, such as the Day Glower, to keep your skin hydrated and soft. 3. Use a gentle exfoliating product, such as the Radiance Revealer, to remove dead skin cells and brighten your complexion. 4. Use an eye serum, such as the Eyes Lifter, to reduce dark circles and puffiness around the eyes. 5. Use a night moisturizer, such as the Night Restorer, to repair and refresh your skin overnight. 6. Apply a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day to protect your skin from sun damage. 7. Avoid using harsh or stripping skincare products that can dry out or damage your skin. 8. Get enough sleep and drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated. 9. Eat a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, as they contain vitamins and antioxidants that are beneficial for the skin. 10. Avoid smoking, excessive alcohol consumption and stress, as they can damage the skin. By following these tips, you can keep your face fresh and soft. Remember to consult a dermatologist if you have any specific skin concerns. \nQ: Which product is the cheapest? \n: I apologize, but I don't have the information about the pricing of the Auolive products. However, I suggest you visit the Auolive website at https://www.auolive.com.sg/ or check with a local retailer to find out the pricing of the products. It's also good to keep in mind that the price of a product is not always an indicator of its effectiveness. Some more expensive products may be of higher quality and worth the investment.\nQ:"
